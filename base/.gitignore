#more information for how to design a gitignore file, please check https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

#A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. 
#For example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar" anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".

# Default ignored files
**/.idea
/shelf/
/workspace.xml
